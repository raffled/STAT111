## Solutions

What Values can $R^2$ take?  

- $0 \le R^2 \le 1$  

What do we call the distance from our line to an observed value of $Y$?

- A residual $(y - \hat{y})$

If $r$ is positive, will the slope $(b_1)$ be positive or negative?

- If $r$ is positive, there is a positive correlation, so the slope **must** be positive

---

If we remove an outlier with an extreme value in $Y$, will $R^2$ go up or down?

- If we remove an outlier, we remove a point far away from the line
- As a group, the points will now fit the shape of the line better
- If the fit is better, $R^2$ will move closer to 1

What does the acronym LSR stand for?

- **L**east **S**quares **R**egression
